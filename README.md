# DogGo

App to practice basic CRUD operations using the MVC design pattern in .NET

Lists Walkers, their name, the neighborhood they service, their associated image, and within each listing is the ability to edit their properties or delete them entirely.

Lists Owners, their name, the neighborhood they belong too, their address, phone, email, and CRUD operations to perform on their listings.

Finally, the app lists dogs, the owner they belong to, their image url, breed, additional notes on them, and options for CRUD operations on them.

Can easily be run from VS.
